# Description
Nexus is mostly similar to earth. With high technology levels, an interstellar naval base and breathable air. There is a high amount of water on the world and cities, states, and countries have grown from the land-masses into the ocean.

# Regions
## Risa
Population: 5,000,000,000 (5 Billion)
The region of Risa is believed to expand from the largest landmass on Nexus. It's history is one of conflict, having been fought over for thousands of years before it's current time of peace. Being the primary location on Nexus, Risa grew from a few small villages to towns to cities until the cities combined to create a single ultra-city, named Nexia.

### Cities
#### Nexia (World Capital)
Region: Risa
Population: 5,000,000,000 (5 Billion)
An ultra-city, where the main starport is located. There is a military base and naval base at the starport.
While the population is extremely high, the city has stretched beyond land creating a spacious and sprawling semi-floating city. The growth of the city was gradual, as such natural soil and vegetation were grown and given space resulting in a surprisingly green ultra-city. The centre of the city is very historical and somewhat of a tourist attraction with many large and lavish buildings. The further towards the edge of the city you go (and closer to "the edge") the more densely packed, and less green, the city gets until you hit the "expansion belt".
At the city is always expanding there is a constant ring around the city dubbed the "expansion belt", where platforms and new "land" is being built and developed.
